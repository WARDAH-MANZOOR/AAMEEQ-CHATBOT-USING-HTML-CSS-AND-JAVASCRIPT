Aameeq is currently conducting market research through a markup model to identify specific content needs and ensure that its library is tailored to the needs of its users.Aameeq\'s VR learning platform offers a number of advantages over traditional learning methods. First, it is more engaging and interactive. VR allows users to learn by doing, which helps them to retain information more effectively. Second, VR is more accessible. Aameeq\'s platform will be available on all major VR headsets, making it easy for users to learn from anywhere. Third, VR is more affordable. Aameeq\'s subscription model will make VR learning more affordable for individuals and businesses alike.In addition to its library of content, Aameeq will also offer a number of features that make it easy to manage and deliver VR learning. For example, Aameeq\'s app will allow users to manage multiple VR headsets and track user progress. Aameeq will also offer a variety of tools and resources to help instructors create and deliver their own VR learning experiences.Aameeq is committed to making learning more accessible, engaging, and affordable for everyone. We believe that VR has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn, and Aameeq is at the forefront of this revolution.Aameeq has found through its market penetration approach that 97% of senior decision-makers in the corporate, government, healthcare, and education sectors in Pakistan have had an immersive VR experience through Aameeq\'s offerings or approach. This has led Aameeq to decide that it needs to redirect its energy towards building a VR ecosystem for Pakistan. To do this, Aameeq is reaching out to different government departments in terms of policy making, conducting advocacy sessions for the academia and corporate sectors, and conducting workshops for students on learning technologies that support VR.Based on market insights, Aameeq has developed the understanding that an AI assistant would be an integral part of all the content that Aameeq has to offer. This is because the market appetite for VR is not just about having an immersive experience, but also about having a better undistracted, assisted experience that clears the user\'s concepts of the available content.';

For simple 360 tours, Aameeq has partnered with IBA Sukkur University. And for marketing and advocacy tasks, Aameeq has partnered with SMIU University.This approach allows Aameeq to focus its resources on strategic initiatives, such as building partnerships and developing its ecosystem. In the future, Aameeq plans to develop its own in-house team for maintenance and support. However, in the early stages of development, it is more cost-effective to outsource major development tasks to academia.Aameeq\'s strategic approach is evident in its partnerships with universities.
